# Building with Closures and this keyword

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of closures and how functions maintain access to their lexical scope.    
- Grasp the dynamic nature of this keyword in JavaScript.    
- Learn how closures can be used to manage and control the value of this in different 
contexts.     
- Apply these concepts to build reusable and modular components in JavaScript.

## Tasks
 1. Object Methods and this:
    - Create a `Person` object with the following properties
        - name (string)
        - age (number)    

    - Add a method `greet()` to the `Person` object that logs a message like `Hello, my name is [name] and I'm [age] years old`.    

    - Experiment with calling `greet()` directly on the `Person` object, using `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`. Observe how the value of this changes in each context.    

 2. Event Handlers and this:    
    - Create a button element in HTML.    
    - Attach an event listener to the button that calls a function `handleClick()`.    
    - Inside `handleClick()`, try to log the properties of the button `(e.g., this.id, this.textContent)`. Observe the value of this.    
    - Modify the code to use an arrow function for the event listener. Notice the difference in how this behaves.    

 3. Private Data with Closures and this:    
    - Create a function `createCounter()` that:
        - Has a private variable `count` initialized to `0`.    
        - Returns an object with two methods:    
            1. `increment()`: Increments the count and logs the new value to the console using `this.count`.    
            2. `getCount()`: Returns the current value of `count`.    

 4. Reusable Component with Closure and this.    
    - Create a function `createTimer(duration, elementId)` that:    
        - Takes a `duration` in seconds and an `elementId` as input.    
        - Starts a timer that counts down from `duration` to `0`.    
        - Updates the content of the element with the given `elementId` to display the remaining time every second.    
        - When the timer reaches `0`, logs a message to the console.    
        - Uses closures to store the timerâ€™s state (remaining time) and `this` to refer to the correct element.
